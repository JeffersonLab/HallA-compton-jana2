/**
 * @struct EvioEventWrapper
 * @brief JANA2 object wrapper for EVIO events
 * 
 * This class wraps EVIO events as JANA2 objects, allowing them to be passed
 * through the JANA2 event processing pipeline. It maintains a shared pointer
 * to the original EVIO event.
 * 
 * JObjects are plain-old data containers for inputs, intermediate results, and outputs.
 * They have member functions for introspection and maintaining associations with other JObjects, but
 * all of the numerical code which goes into their creation should live in a JFactory instead.
 * You are allowed to include STL containers and pointers to non-POD datatypes inside your JObjects,
 * however, it is highly encouraged to keep them flat and include only primitive datatypes if possible.
 * Think of a JObject as being a row in a database table, with event number as an implicit foreign key.
